			<p>She woke me up with a bang, bang<br>
			Looking over cross eyed had a big<br>
			Hunch that the world was a big lie<br>
			When I got up all the blood to my head<br>
			I got so dizzy fell back to my bed<br>
			I went over to the way side<br>
			Looking for the high tide<br>
			What will I find will I find will I find find<br>
			All I saw was a man that had a hat<br>
			That had a pom-pom he's been there for<br>
			Years can someone tell me how long<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			Wake up to tell me<br>
			Wake up to show me<br>
			What I could not find<br>
			<br>
			You see this woman woke me up<br>
			At a quarter to three and I didn't<br>
			Know it then but she put a spell on <br>
			Me said I had to go down to where<br>
			The cliffs mee the sea and mean an<br>
			Old man to present my plea<br>
			So I headed way down to the big pier<br>
			To await and confront my big fear<br>
			I wheeled around behind to my<br>
			Blindside to find and old man with a<br>
			Lime and a kind eye<br>
			Said mister, mister with your beard so long<br>
			Won't you be a saint and tell me<br>
			Just where I'm going<br>
			He pointed to a conch shell and then<br>
			To the lime and said this is all<br>
			I really need to get by<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]<br>
			<br>
			Hey mister man<br>
			I know you don't know<br>
			Who you think I, think I am<br>
			But I can safely say, that I<br>
			Should've been sleeping the day<br>
			Away I said scuse me, if you've got the<br>
			Time he shrugged his shoulders<br>
			Said get a spine<br>
			Coconut hit me on the head<br>
			Jonesin' for a fig<br>
			I booked last night<br>
			I need another fix<br>
			Just then I see a twinkle twinkle<br>
			In the old man's eye and a wave<br>
			Tossed bottle in thrown to the sky<br>
			<br>
			I caught it on the rebound<br>
			It landed with a soft sound<br>
			I took out the message and put the<br>
			Bottle down<br>
			Inside was the antidote to the spell<br>
			And I read it to the old man 'cause he<br>
			Couldn't read so well<br>
			Said don't worry about a <br>
			Thing you know your<br>
			Path is true just ease your<br>
			Mind have a banana<br>
			Or two<br>
			<br>
			Goodness, goodness, woe is me<br>
			The man nearly flipped to learn<br>
			That he was free but just before we<br>
			Left and started kicking it<br>
			I picked up the bottle and star sixed it<br>
			<br>
			Kick kick shuffle shuffle back to the beach<br>
			With a tune on my lips and my quest in reach<br>
			<br>
			If that woman comes to you with<br>
			Her song so sweet, say damn<br>
			Let the poor sucker sleep</p>
