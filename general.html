			<p>there was a decorated general with<br>
				a heart of gold, that likened him to<br>
				all the stories he told<br>
				of past battles, won and lost, and<br>
				legends of old a seasoned veteran in<br>
				his own time<br>
				<br>
				on the battlefield, he gained<br>
				respectful fame with many medals<br>
				of bravery and stripes to his name<br>
				he grew a beard as soon as he could<br>
				to cover the scars on his face<br>
				and always urged his men on<br>
				<br>
				but on the eve of a great battle<br>
				with the infantry in dream<br>
				the old general tossed in his sleep<br>
				and wrestled with its meaning<br>
				he awoke from the night<br>
				just to tell what he had seen<br>
				and walked slowly out of his tent<br>
				<br>
				all the men held tall with their<br>
				chests in the air, with courage in<br>
				their blood and a fire in their stare<br>
				it was a grey morning and they all<br>
				wondered how they would fare<br>
				till the old general told them to go home<br>
				<br>
				<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br>
				He said: I have seen the others<br>
				and I have discovered<br>
				that this fight is not worth fighting<br>
				I have seen their mothers<br>
				and I will no other<br>
				to follow me where I'm going<br>
				<br>
				So,take a shower, shine your shoes<br>
				you got no time to lose<br>
				you are young men you must be living<br>
				Take a shower, shine your shoes<br>
				you got no time to lose<br>
				you are young men you must be living<br>
				go now you are forgiven<br>
				<br>
				but the men stood fast with their<br>
				guns on their shoulders not knowing<br>
				what to do with the contradicting orders<br>
				the general said he would do his own<br>
				duty but would extend it no further<br>
				the men could go as they pleased<br>
				<br>
				but not a man moved, their eyes gazed straight ahead<br>
				till one by one<br>
				they stepped back and not a word was said<br>
				and the old general was left with his<br>
				own words echoing in his head<br>
				he then prepared to fight<br>
				<br>
				[CHORUS]<br>
				<br>
				go now you are forgiven</p>
